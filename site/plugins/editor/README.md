- Numbered List
- Quote

You need more? Create your own block type extensions to integrate the Editor into your projects seamlessly.

### Markdown shortcuts

Writing your articles and copy always feels natural in the Editor. Use markdown shortcuts such as `#`, `-`, `****` and more to add new blocks without ever leaving your keyboard.

### Drag & Drop sorting of blocks

Use the intuitive drag & drop interface to rearrange blocks.

### Customizable HTML

The HTML of each block can be fine-tuned and customized. Create your own block snippets and use Kirby's familiar template engine to create the markup you are looking for.

### HTML & Markdown import

Import HTML & Markdown or paste content directly into the Editor to create new blocks. The smart parser of the Editor will always give you clean structured data for even the worst HTML (We are looking at you, Word)
