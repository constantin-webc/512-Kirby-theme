# Todo block extension

This demo block shows how to create a composition of multiple input elements. In this case a simple checkbox is combined with a content editable field.

This example is quite advanced, as it passes a lot of events to the editor and showcases most of its functionalities.

Blocks can be more simple than that. Check out the default image block as a good example of more simple blocks.

## Installation

You can install this demo extension as a regular Kirby plugin by placing the todo-block folder in site/plugins

## Docs

I've added lots of annotations to the index.php, index.css and index.js to give you a better idea how things work.
